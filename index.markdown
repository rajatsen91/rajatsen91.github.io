I am a Research Scientist at Google Research, MTV. I am currently excited about pretrained models for time-series forecasting as well as other less explored modalities. I am one of the creators of [TimesFM](https://github.com/google-research/timesfm). I am also working on making inference of LLMs >2x faster.

I obtained my PhD from UT Austin in 2019 where I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Sanjay Shakkottai](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~shakkott/Sanjay_Shakkottai/Contact.html). I also had the pleasure of working closely with [Dr. Alex Dimakis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/), during my time at UT. I have worked on contextual bandits, extreme classification and black-box optimization.
